## CO₂ Emissions Monitoring Solution Pathway

This repository hosts an interactive, Twine-based pathway designed to support municipalities, SMEs, and technical development partners in exploring what it takes to develop or continue a Do Data–like CO₂ emissions monitoring solution.

The pathway is part of the **Do Data – for a Greener Future** pilot under the  
**Interreg North Sea Region: Data for All** programme.
